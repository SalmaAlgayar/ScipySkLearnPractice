Write a Python program using scipy.stats to do the following:

You have two independent samples of test scores:
group_A: [88, 92, 79, 93, 85]
group_B: [91, 87, 74, 89, 90]

Use an appropriate statistical test to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups at a 95% confidence level.
Print the test statistic and the p-value, and interpret the result.
